<h1>User Interface Specification</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This document provides an overview of the user interface. It is very brief as the majority of the interface is specified more in depth in the keyboard and graphics specifications.
<h2>Key Terms and Concepts</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The user interface is split into two main sections: the simulation section which take up the majority of the screen, and the <i>interface bar</i> along the bottom. This consists of the <i>mode indicator</i> and the <i>command prompt</i><br/><br/>

The user is able to interface with the simulation via various Vim inspired <i>key binds</i>, for example, hitting the <i>":"</i> key will put the user into <i>insert mode</i>. Hitting <i>Esc</i> will return the user back into <i>normal mode</i>. For more information on all the key bindings, please see the keyboard specification document.</p>

<h2>Modes</h2>
<p>
The user interface allows for three different modes: <i>Insert mode</i>, <i>select mode</i>, or <i>normal mode</i>, which are explained below:
<ul>
  <li>Insert mode: A user is able to type <i>commands</i> into the <i>command prompt</i>, normal key binds don't work as all key presses are sent to the command prompt area.</li>
  <li>Normal mode: A user is able to use regular <i>key binds</i>, which are shortcuts to regular commands.</li>
  <li>Selection mode: A user is able to use <i>HJKL</i> or the arrow keys to select an area which is then provided as an argument to a <i>command</i>, which could, for example, delete all agents within it.
</ul>


</p>
<h2>Layout</h2>
Below in figure 1. is an illustration of the user interface with an explanation of each component:

Components:
<ol>
  <li>Graphics: This is where the simulation will be displayed</li>
  <li>Mode indicator: This is where the current mode the UI is in will be displayed</li>
  <li>Command prompt: This is where the user is able to enter <i>commands</i> to interact with the simulation.</li>
</ol>
